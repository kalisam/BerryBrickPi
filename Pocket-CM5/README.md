# Reproducable
The main PCB and Flex-PCB are easily reproducible at JLCPCB. You can open the project in EasyEDA Pro and simply click Order PCB. Everything is already configured for JLCPCB — you only need to adjust anything you feel is necessary.

**Here are some optional tips for ordering:**

- Make sure you use the default JLCPCB stack-up: JLC04161H-7628 (or just leave Specify Stackup set to No).
- The board already includes a 5×5 mm rectangular silkscreen area for the JLCPCB 2D barcode. Choose 2D Barcode (Serial Number), select 5×5 mm size, and Specify Position.
- All components are compatible with Economic Assembly. Extended parts cost slightly more but are still cheaper than Standard.
- For better cost efficiency, it’s recommended to order 10 pcs. Group-ordering for multiple people is often the most affordable approach.

# Project on EasyEda Pro
- For the best PCB and schematic appearance, please install the **Roboto Condensed** and **Roboto Condensed Bold** fonts first.
- You may modify and reproduce the design as you like, but please keep the license intact.
- Always follow the design rules and run DRC checks before manufacturing.
